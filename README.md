# SiEPIC_Photonics_Package
A Python (v3.6.5) package to be used in the photonics group

# Functions
* calibrate

Calibrates an input spectrum response with respect to another input response

* baseline_correction

Calibrates an input response with respect to it's baseline

* cutback

Extrapolate the losses of different input data files losses using the cutback method 

* to_s_params

Converts the input data to generate a .dat file compatible with Lumerical INTERCONNECT's N-port s-parameter file format

# Simulators and solvers
* EM_solver

Eigenmode solver for a 2D waveguide structure

* Ring_Designer

Microrings designer: model N-order rings system spectrum

* MZI_simulator

Simulate the spectrum of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with different input parameters

* Bragg_TMM

Model the response of a Bragg grating based on the transfer matrix method (TMM)

* Contra_DC

Model the response of a contra-directional coupler based on coupled mode theory (CMT) and transfer matrix method
